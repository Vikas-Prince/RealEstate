# Real Estate Web Application

## About the Project

This is a PHP-based real estate web application designed to facilitate the management and browsing of properties for sale or rent. It allows users to easily search, filter, and view property listings, while enabling property owners and agents to add, edit, or manage their listings. The platform also features an intuitive admin dashboard to manage user accounts, listings, and general settings.

The concept of this application revolves around providing a seamless experience for both prospective buyers/renters and real estate agents, as well as enabling effective property management by admins.

### Key Features:

- **User Interface**: Allows users to browse, filter, and search for properties based on different criteria (e.g., price, location, type, etc.).
- **Admin Panel**: Provides admin users with the ability to manage property listings, users, agents, and other essential data.
- **Agent Management**: Allows agents to manage and upload their property listings.
- **Property Details**: Detailed pages for each property, including images, descriptions, pricing, and location.
- **MySQL Database**: A relational database (MySQL) is used to store user data, property listings, agent details, and transaction information.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language used to build the logic and manage interactions between users, agents, and the database.
- **MySQL**: Relational database system used to store application data.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies to design and manage the UI.
- **XAMPP**: A local server environment used for testing and running the application on your machine.

## How the Application Works

The web application consists of two main sections:

- **User Page**: The frontend where users can browse and search for properties, filter listings, and view detailed information about each property.
- **Admin Page**: The backend where admins can manage property listings, agents, and users, ensuring smooth operation of the platform.

## How to Run the Application Locally

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Install XAMPP

If you haven't already installed XAMPP, download and install it from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

XAMPP is an open-source platform that packages Apache, PHP, and MySQL into a single easy-to-install package.

### 2. Start XAMPP Server

1. Open the **XAMPP Control Panel**.
2. Start both the **Apache** and **MySQL** servers. These are the web server and database server required to run the app.

### 3. Set Up the Database

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** by navigating to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your browser.
2. Create a new database named `realestate`.
3. Import the database schema by doing the following:
   - In the **phpMyAdmin** interface, select the `realestate` database.
   - Click on the **Import** tab.
   - Choose the `realestatephp.sql` file (or any equivalent file you have) and click **Go** to import the database.

### 4. Place the Application Files

1. Navigate to your XAMPP installation directory. By default, this is usually `C:\xampp\htdocs`.
2. Create a new folder inside the `htdocs` directory (e.g., `realestate`).
3. Place all of the project files (PHP, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) into this folder.

### 5. Access the Application

- Open a browser and go to `http://localhost/realestate/index.php` (replace `realestate` with your project folder name if it's different).
- You should now be able to view the homepage and access all functionalities.

### 6. Login as Admin or User

- To access the admin panel, use the default login credentials (provided separately or in your documentation).
- Users can register and log in to explore and browse properties.
